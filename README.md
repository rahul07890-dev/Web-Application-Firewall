# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Overview
This Java-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection for web applications by inspecting and filtering incoming HTTP requests to detect and block malicious traffic such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The WAF applies predefined security rules to protect web applications from common web vulnerabilities.

---

## Features
- SQL Injection Detection: Detects and blocks SQL injection attempts.
- **XSS Protection: Blocks malicious scripts designed to execute in the user's browser.
- **CSRF Protection: Prevents unauthorized actions from being performed on behalf of authenticated users.
- **Custom Security Rules: Users can define custom rules to enhance security based on specific needs.
- **Request Logging: Logs and provides detailed information about blocked requests for security auditing.
  
---

## Technologies Used
- **Java: For implementing the WAF’s core logic.
- **Servlets & JSP: For handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **Regex & Pattern Matching: For identifying malicious content in requests.
- **web.xml: For servlet filter configuration.
