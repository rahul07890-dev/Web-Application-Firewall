Web Application Firewall (WAF)
This Java-based Web Application Firewall (WAF) provides protection for web applications by inspecting and filtering incoming HTTP requests to detect and block malicious traffic such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The WAF applies predefined security rules to protect web applications from common web vulnerabilities.

Features
SQL Injection Detection: Detects and blocks SQL injection attempts.

XSS Protection: Blocks malicious scripts designed to execute in the user's browser.

CSRF Protection: Prevents unauthorized actions from being performed on behalf of authenticated users.

Custom Security Rules: Users can define custom rules to enhance security based on specific needs.

Request Logging: Logs and provides detailed information about blocked requests for security auditing.

Technologies Used
Java: For implementing the WAF’s core logic.

Servlets & JSP: For handling HTTP requests and responses.

Regex & Pattern Matching: For identifying malicious content in requests.

web.xml: For servlet filter configuration.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rahul07890-dev/Web-Application-Firewall.git
cd Web-Application-Firewall
Build and deploy the project in a Java web container (e.g., Tomcat).

Access the application via the browser at http://localhost:8080.

Future Enhancements
Advanced Security Rules: Add more sophisticated detection for new web vulnerabilities.

Performance Optimization: Improve filtering and logging mechanisms for better performance.

UI Improvements: Enhance the frontend for a more user-friendly experience.

Additional Threat Protection: Integrate protection against other types of web attacks.
